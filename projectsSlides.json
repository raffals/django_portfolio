It has a built-in, real-time preview system for both the module being developed, and how the current Front Page (at www.yahoo.com) will look when the new module is added.  An integrated Help/FAQ system is also built in.  At time of completion, this internal tool was also already planned for use by Yahoo!'s Argentina, Mexico, Singapore, and Telemundo Front Pages, as well as by other groups with pages subordinate to both the US Front Page and some of the foreign Yahoo! Front Pages.",
