The project was funded by her parents, who hired me to develop the site and work with her directly (so she could learn how websites and web applications function and come into being).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe application was integrated with Facebook (allowing registration and login via Facebook account), and functioned similarly to Facebook.  It included a private administration web app functionality that allowed for suspending or deleting users, direct addition/modification of different favorites and categories of favorites, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, the work we did on that site - and the extensive database of users and favorites they built over the years it was in use - has been lost.  However, knowing Facebook, you can easily imagine how it worked.
